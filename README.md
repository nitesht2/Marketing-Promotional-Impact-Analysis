# Promotional Impact Analysis

## About
- In this project, I will create a promotional impact dashboard to analyze and display key KPIs. In the dashboard, each visualization is synced up so that if one of the value change, it applies to the other visualization as well. This dashboard is for reporting purposes.

## Findings:
- Form the sales workbook it shows that there are some promotions which were effective and some of them were not. This dashboard will help the marketing team easily drill down different promotions throughout the year. Upon clicking on the peak of 2017 in the sales workbook, it displays the total sales during that time and the name of the promotion. The marketing team will further study this high-performance week, find the theme for the week or discount, or the content used in the promotion then compare it with others. This will further  help to understand what was so different about this promotion from other promotions and help to run effective promotions in the future.
